## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`WeddingModel`**](#weddingmodel-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `WeddingModel` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- In particular, it listens for changes to the `UniqueWeddingList`, as well as the `UniquePersonList` of
    the currently open wedding.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `WeddingPlannerParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a wedding).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `WeddingPlannerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddWeddingCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddWeddingCommand`) which the `WeddingPlannerParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddWeddingCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### WeddingModel component


**API** : [`WeddingModel.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/WeddingModel.java)


<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `WeddingModel` component,

- stores the wedding planner data i.e., all `Wedding` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueWeddingList` object) and all `Person` objects (which are contained in each `Wedding` object's `UniquePersonList`)
- exposes the data to the outside as `ReadOnlyWeddingPlanner` objects that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that whe each wedding is selected, the UI updates to show the selected Wedding's data i.e., all the `Person` objects within it
- stores the currently 'selected' `Wedding` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Wedding>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `WeddingModel` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

#### Key Model Classes

- **WeddingPlanner**: The central data structure that holds all weddings
- **Wedding**: Represents a wedding event with the following properties:
  - `date`: The scheduled date for the wedding
  - `title`: The name/title of the wedding
  - `bride`: A reference to a Person representing the bride
  - `groom`: A reference to a Person representing the groom
  - `members`: A UniquePersonList of other people involved in the wedding
- **WeddingModel**: Extends the base AB3 Model interface with wedding-specific operations
- **WeddingModelManager**: The implementation of the WeddingModel interface that:
  - Manages the current wedding context (the active wedding being edited)
  - Handles draft wedding creation and commitment
  - Provides operations for adding, editing, and removing people from weddings

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `WeddingPlanner`, which `Person` references. This allows `WeddingPlanner` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both wedding planner data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `WeddingPlannerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `WeddingModel` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `WeddingModel`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

### Saving Data

1. **Dealing with Missing/Corrupted Data Files**

    1. **Simulating a Missing Data File**:
    
        - **Execution**: Navigate to the application's data directory and delete the data file (i.e. data/weddingplanner.json).
        
        - **Test Case**: Launch the application after deleting the data file.
        
            - **Expected Outcome**: The application starts with an sample list of weddings. A new data file by the same name is created upon exiting the application.

    2. **Simulating a Corrupted Data File**:
    
        - **Execution**: Open the data file in a text editor and intentionally break its format (e.g., delete a brace, alter tags, insert random characters).
        
        - **Test Case**: Launch the application after corrupting the file.
        
            - **Expected Outcome**: The application detects the corrupted file and logs that as the datafile could not be loaded, a new and empty file has been created. 
            - User can then manually fix the crropted file or input their wedding details from scratch.

2. **Verifying Data Persistence After Application Restart**

    - **Prerequisites**: The application is running and at least one wedding has been added.

    - **Test Case**: Close the application and re-launch it.

        - **Expected Outcome**: All previously entered data (weddings, people, preferences) are correctly loaded and displayed.
